# Introduction

One of the things people have difficulty with when learning a new programming language is coming up with ways to practice using it. I hope to give some help with this document by compiling a list of useful exercises that people can draw from. These could be useful as part of an R workshop, or even used in a course that uses R where some of the students would like a bit more practice with the language. 

# Exercises

## If statements


## Function creation


## Loops


## Builtin function knowledge

1. Given the vector `x`, how can you check if any of the values are greater than 10?
```{r eval=FALSE}
any(x > 10)
```
