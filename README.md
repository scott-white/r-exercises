## Introduction

One of the things people have difficulty with when learning a new programming language is coming up with ways to practice using it. I hope to give some help with this document by compiling a list of useful exercises that people can draw from. These could be useful as part of an R workshop, or even used in a course that uses R where some of the students would like a bit more practice with the language.
